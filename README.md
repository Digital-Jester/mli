# My Linux Installer (mli.sh)
 
If your like me and love a good terminal screen, but hate typing the same command over and over again. You put it in an automatic script right?

So here is my script for Debian based Linux distro's.
  
Script currently includes;
- Crypto Miners
- Open Media Vault (OMV)

## Usage

1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digital-Jester/mli/main/mli.sh`

2. `chmod +x mli.sh`

3. `sudo ./mli.sh`
