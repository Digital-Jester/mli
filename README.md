# My Linux Installer (mli.sh)
 
If your like me and love a good terminal screen, but hate typing the same command over and over again. You put it in an automatic helper script right?

So here is my script for Debian based Linux distro's.
  
Script currently includes;
- Crypto Miner Installers
- Open Media Vault (OMV) Install
- CLI Package Installers

## Usage

1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digital-Jester/mli/main/mli.sh && chmod +x mli.sh`

2. `sudo ./mli.sh`
